# Overview

This is a simple site that allows users to register to or book events. The registration details are saved in an admin database and able to be accessed and managed on the back end.

# Web Pages

The home page is essentially a list of all available events to book or register for. The book event page is accessed by clicking one of the event buttons and it allows the user to input basic information such as Name and Email address.

# Development Environment

I used the Django framework in Python for this project. I used a virtual environment to create it and manage the server.
